TIPS
To open/close the door, select the "Door" item and turn the Door Open/Close dial on the Parameters palette. Select Figure > Use Limits in main menu to limit door rotation.

The toilet paper and flystrip props are intended to be loaded separately from the main outhouse model for scene flexibility. However, if used, they are parented to "Outhouse".

Uncheck "Smooth polygons" in FireFly Render Settings for best rendering results.
